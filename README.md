# MyFirstGraphicalPerceptron
A single perceptron with adjustable  training and testing rounds which gives neat graphical output about its success rate. Inspired byDaniel Shiffman's [10.2: Neural Networks: Perceptron Part 1 - The Nature of Code

### Instructions: 
Change the range (min, max) and number testing/training rounds and see, both visually and statistically, the changing success rate! 
Also, the perceptron currently considers points s.t y>x as +1, feel free to change that to any other conditional (in the Point constructor) and test what happens!
