# MyFirstGraphicalPerceptron
A single perceptron with adjustable  training and testing rounds which gives neat graphical output about its success rate. Inspired byDaniel Shiffman's [10.2: Neural Networks: Perceptron Part 1 - The Nature of Code

### Instructions: 
Feel free to play: 
- The range of points (min, max)
- Number testing/training rounds
- The "label formula" currently considers points s.t y>x as +1 (in Point Constructor)
**Enjoy** ğŸ¤— 

###### Note: 
Unfortuntly I had more features (set your own equation,bias, etc), but they all were mysteriously deleted ğŸ˜¥
